    questions: [
      {
        q: "What is solar energy and how does it work?",
        a: "Solar energy is power derived from the sun's radiation. Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels on your rooftop capture sunlight and convert it into DC (Direct Current) electricity. An inverter then converts this DC electricity into AC (Alternating Current) electricity, which can be used to power your home, business, or industrial unit in Karachi."

      {
        q: "Why should I switch to solar energy with SUNFINITY in Pakistan?",
        a: (
          <>
            <p className="mb-2">Switching to solar with SUNFINITY offers numerous advantages, especially in Pakistan:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-600">
              <li><strong>Significant Bill Reduction:</strong> Reduce your K-Electric (or other utility) bills by an average of 50%.</li>
              <li><strong>Combat Load Shedding:</strong> With our SUNFINITY PowerBank solutions, enjoy uninterrupted power supply. Expect around 4 hours of backup on typical full load with 200-300Ah battery setups.</li>
              <li><strong>Eco-Friendly:</strong> Lower your carbon footprint and contribute to a greener Pakistan.</li>
              <li><strong>Energy Independence:</strong> Decrease reliance on the national grid and protect yourself from rising electricity tariffs.</li>
              <li><strong>Net Metering Benefits:</strong> Export surplus energy back to the grid (e.g., K-Electric) and earn credits on your bill.</li>
              <li><strong>Increased Property Value:</strong> Solar installations are a smart investment that can enhance property appeal.</li>
            </ul>

        q: "What types of solar systems does SUNFINITY install?",
        a: "SUNFINITY specializes in complete solar solutions tailored to your needs, including grid-tied systems (with net metering), hybrid systems (grid-tied with battery backup like our SUNFINITY PowerBank â€“ highly recommended for areas with load shedding), and off-grid systems. We handle the entire project for residential, commercial, and industrial clients, providing high-quality solar panels, inverters, and advanced LiFePO4 batteries."

    category: "Costs, Savings & Incentives",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "How much can I typically save with a SUNFINITY solar system?",
        a: "Our clients typically see an average reduction of 50% in their electricity bills. For instance, an air conditioner that might consume 5-6 units per hour from the grid can have its grid consumption reduced to 2-3 units per hour when powered by solar during the day. Actual savings vary based on your system size, energy usage patterns, and local utility tariffs."
      },
      {
        q: "What is the payback period for a solar investment in Karachi?",
        a: "The payback period for a solar system in Karachi generally ranges from 3 to 6 years. This depends on your initial investment, the amount of electricity your system generates, your savings on utility bills, and any benefits from net metering."
      },
      {
        q: "Are there government incentives or financing for solar in Pakistan?",
        a: "The Government of Pakistan and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) often introduce policies and financing schemes to promote renewable energy, including solar. These can include concessional financing rates or potential tax benefits on solar equipment. SUNFINITY can provide information on currently available schemes."

    category: "Net Metering in Karachi",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "What is net metering with K-Electric?",
        a: "Net metering is a system that allows you to send any surplus electricity generated by your SUNFINITY solar system back to the K-Electric grid. K-Electric will then credit your electricity bill for this exported energy, which can further reduce your monthly costs significantly or even result in a net credit."
      },
      {
        q: "Does SUNFINITY help with the K-Electric net metering application?",
        a: "Yes, absolutely. SUNFINITY provides end-to-end service, which includes assisting you with the complete net metering application process, documentation, and coordination with K-Electric for the installation of the bidirectional meter."
